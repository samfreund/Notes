A significant part of this advertisement centers around the idea that indian land is not their own, and that it's free for the taking by others. We see the picture of 
a native american, designed to make them seem old and worn out, in contrast to the American frontier, the new up and coming thing. Looking more closely, we see that 
this is a practice that has been going on for a long time, and we particularly notice that the Department of the Interior is the one conducting these sales. Nowhere do 
we see an indication that the native americans themselves are the ones selling the land.
